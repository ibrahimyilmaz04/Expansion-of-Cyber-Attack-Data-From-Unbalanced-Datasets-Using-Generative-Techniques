I have implemented a GAN model that can produce samples of different attack labels(e.g.  blacklist,  anomaly  spam,  ssh  scan).  I  have  been  able  to generate as many samples as necessary based on the data sample I  have  taken  from  the  UGR 16 dataset. I have tested the accuracy of our model with the imbalance dataset initially and then with the  increasing  the  attack  samples  and  found  improvement  of classification  performance  for  the  latter.
