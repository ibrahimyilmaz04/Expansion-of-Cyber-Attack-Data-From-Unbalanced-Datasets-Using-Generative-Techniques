We have implemented a GAN model that can produce samples of different attack labels(e.g.  blacklist,  anomaly  spam,  ssh  scan).  We  have  been  able  to generate as many samples as necessary based on the data sample we  have  taken  from  the  UGR 16 dataset.  We  have  tested  the  accuracy of our model with the imbalance dataset initially and then with the  increasing  the  attack  samples  and  found  improvement  of classification  performance  for  the  latter.
