We have implemented a GAN model that can produce samples of different attack labels(e.g.  blacklist,  anomaly  spam,  ssh  scan).  We  have  been  able  togenerate as many samples as necessary based on the data samplewe  have  taken  from  the  UGR16.  We  have  tested  the  accuracyof our model with the imbalance dataset initially and then withthe  increasing  the  attack  samples  and  found  improvement  ofclassification  performance  for  the  latter.
